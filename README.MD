# Java Eshop Project (BlueJ)
This Eshop project is an implementation in Java using BlueJ as part of my university project for the Computer Engineering and Informatics Department (CEID). The project simulates an online bookstore that offers various items such as pen, paper, pencil, and notebook, represented as classes within the application.

## Project Overview
The Java Eshop project also consists of the following key classes:

**Owner Class**: Represents the owner of the Eshop, responsible for managing the inventory and processing orders.  

**User Class**: Represents potential buyers of items from the Eshop. Users can browse products, add items to the shopping cart, and place orders.  

**ShoppingCart Class**: Manages the items selected by users for purchase. It allows users to add and remove items from their cart before proceeding to checkout.  

**Menu Class**: Provides an interface for customers to interact with the Eshop. It displays available items, handles user inputs, and guides them through the shopping process.  

## Features
**User Registration**: New users can create accounts to access the Eshop and place orders.

**Product Browsing**: Customers can browse through the available items in the Eshop.

**Shopping Cart**: Users can add items to their shopping cart for purchase.

## Technologies Used
The Eshop project is implemented in Java using BlueJ as the development environment. It utilizes object-oriented programming principles and Java classes to represent various functionalities and interactions within the application.
